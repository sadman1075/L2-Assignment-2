## Explain the Primary Key and Foreign Key concepts in PostgreSQL.

In PostgreSQL, a Primary Key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It enforces uniqueness and ensures that no null values are allowed in the column(s) defined as the primary key. For example, a ranger_id column in a rangers table can be designated as the primary key to uniquely identify each ranger. A Foreign Key, on the other hand, is used to establish a relationship between two tables. It is a column or set of columns in one table that references the primary key of another table. This relationship enforces referential integrity, meaning that values in the foreign key column must match existing values in the referenced table. For example, in a sightings table, the ranger_id can be a foreign key that references rangers(ranger_id), ensuring that every sighting is associated with a valid ranger. These key constraints are crucial for maintaining data consistency and building relational structures that reflect real-world relationships between data entities.
